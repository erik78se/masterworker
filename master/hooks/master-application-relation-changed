    changes its settings for the relation. It should be the only hook that relies upon remote relation settings from
    relation-get, and it should not error if the settings are incomplete: you can guarantee that when the remote unit
    changes its settings, the hook will be run again.

    The settings that you can get, and that you should set, are determined by the relationâ€™s interface.
