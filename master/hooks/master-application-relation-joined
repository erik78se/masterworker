    [name]-relation-joined is run only when that remote unit is first observed by the unit.
    It should be used to relation-set any local unit settings that can be determined using no more than the name of the
    joining unit and the remote private-address setting, which is always available when the relation is created and is
    by convention not deleted.

    You should not depend upon any other relation settings in the -joined hook because theyâ€™re not guaranteed to be
    present; if you need more information you should wait for a -changed hook that presents the right information.
